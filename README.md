# Covmap

## Description:

Covmap is a tool that helps anyone to see and track the spread of the Covid-19 and at the same time see what is the sentiment
of the population around the world.

## Goal:

Because dealing with all the information from the news posts and tweets is some times hard  to keep up with.
Covmap is the best place where we can aggregate this data and see how fluctuation of infected people can affect the 
mood of people and vice versa.
